<h1>Pocketful of Sunshine by Natasha Bedingfield</h1>
<p>I used a dictionary to write the code in Java to create a word frequency of our song lyrics. A dictionary seemed like the best data structure for this task because its use of a key-value pair made it easy to keep track of the number of times a word appeared in the song. Alternatively I could have used a Queue, LinkedList, Graph, Stack, Tree, or Array. None of those seemed like a good option, however. I could have created an object called word and given it a private int value that kept track of the number of times each word was used and then used a Linkedlist but a HashMap was easier to implement.

I used this data visualization technique because I thought it would look best
    Why did you choose the particular data visualization technique?
    Is there anything youâ€™d want to improve if you had more time to work on the project? How might you scale the project?
    Describe context and rationale for selecting the about the song(s) presented, here are some thought questions to get you started:
    Why did you choose this particular song?
    Was the song ever a billboard top hit? When?
    What were the top words found? Was it a surprise?
    Can you find the value of each word? Of the top words? This would involve researching sales and calculating price per word.
